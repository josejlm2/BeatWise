# BeatWise
The purpose of BeatWise is to build a digital classifier of a user using heartbeat data from a Fitbit Charge HR and images taken from a Narrative Clip. By overlaying a spike in heart rate with images of what occurred during the spike, the team plans on classifying future spikes into a positive or negative event.


### Heartbeat Data Algorithm 

At this time in the project, we are focusing on processing the heartbeat data collected from the FitBit. The algorithm has been split into two parts: heartbeat classifier and signal comparison. Each part has been place in a different branch. You can easily find them by following the links below.
