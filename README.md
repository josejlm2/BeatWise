# BeatWise
The purpose of BeatWise is to build a digital classifier of a user using heartbeat data from a Fitbit Charge HR and images taken from a Narrative Clip. By overlaying a spike in heart rate with images of what occurred during the spike, the team plans on classifying future spikes into a positive or negative event.
