# BeatWise
The purpose of BeatWise is to build a digital classifier of a user using heartbeat data from a Fitbit Charge HR and images taken from a Narrative Clip. By overlaying a spike in heart rate with images of what occurred during the spike, the team plans on classifying future spikes into a positive or negative event.



###HearBeat Classifier

For this part, data collected during a day will be taken to preprocess. The idea is to get the rate of heartbeats change and the heartbeat level. This information is needed in order to make clusters, or events, that will helps pick out the signals needed for comparison.
